# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Introduction

This assignment was a task to evaluate several machine learning techniques on a given data set and determine which methodology produces the most accurate results.  Our data set is developed for identifying credit risk for a given population set and the following methods 

1. Naive random oversampling
2. SMOTE oversampling
3. Cluster Centroid Oversampling
4. SMOTEENN Sampling
5. Balanced random Forest
6. Easy Ensemble

Results for each are shown below. 


## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling

-Accuracy :62.8%

## Summary

Easy ensemble has a significantly stronger accuracy and identification strength then any of the other methods chosen here.  I would recommend highly that several other datasets be tested first, but it is highly likely this is the strongest technique for this.
